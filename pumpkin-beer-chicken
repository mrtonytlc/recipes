1 (14 ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (4 ounce) can diced green chilies

for serving

Instructions
Scatter the onions in the bottom of the crockpot. Add the red peppers, andouille sausage, tomatoes,
green chilies, hot sauce, chili powder, paprika, thyme, cayenne, salt and pepper. Add the chicken and
beer. Submerge the chicken.
Cook on low for 78
hours or high for 4 hours.
30 minutes before the chicken is done cooking, add the corn starch mixture and stir to combine. Cook
on high for 20 to 30 minutes more or until the sauce thickens. If the sauce gets too thick, too fast you
may add water or chicken broth to thin. If the sauce is not thickening enough, leave the lid off for 30
minutes.
Serve with rice, [beer bread | http://www.halfbakedharvest.com/5ingredientbeerbread/]
